/**
  * Equilibrium is the state in which market supply and demand balance each other, and as a result prices become stable
  *
  * Integrating Bullish Crossovers
  *
  * bullish refers to a strong signal for continuously rising prices
  *
  * In the case of a bullish MACD, this will occur when the histogram value is above the equilibrium line, and also when the MACD line is of greater value than the nine-day EMA, also called the "MACD signal line."
  * The stochastic's bullish divergence occurs when %K value passes the %D, confirming a likely price turnaround.
  *
  * Strategy:
  *
  * First, look for the bullish crossovers to occur within two days of each other.
  * When applying the stochastic and MACD double-cross strategy, ideally, the crossover occurs below the 50-line on the stochastic to catch a longer price move.
  * And preferably, you want the histogram value to already be or move higher than zero within two days of placing your trade.
  *
  * MACD must cross slightly after the stochastic, as the alternative could create a false indication of the price trend or place you in a sideways trend.
